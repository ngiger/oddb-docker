h1. Purpose

Setup an infrastructure which can be easily duplicated to run test (unit-tests and Watir). Based on "docker":https://www.docker.com/ and "docker-compose":https://docs.docker.com/compose/.

As some of the tests take many hours to complete, eg. check the whole import_daily it is desirable that the developer has the possibility to run several of these test in parallel. This will allow working on a feature branch and fixing some (hopefully small) problem in the production branch.

The work is based on https://github.com/ngiger/vagrant-oddb_org and the accumulated experience of the last 2 and half year.

It is unclear if and upto which extent we reuse the puppet modules.

h2. Design decisions

* Move from vagrant to docker to speed up running a server (going down from minutes to seconds).
